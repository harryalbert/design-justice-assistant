## Design-Justice Assistant
This project allows anyone to interact with an AI assistant dedicated to helping programmers and designers think critically about how their projects align with ethical and community-centric design practices, specifically those outlined by the Design Justice Network. The main goals are to foster discussions that prioritize the needs and inputs of community members affected by design outcomes, to encourage collaborative and accountable design processes, and to promote sustainable and non-exploitative solutions. By questioning and guiding through these principles, we can help create technology that is responsible, inclusive, and beneficial to all, particularly those often marginalized in traditional design processes. You can access a [live demo here](https://design-justice-assistant.vercel.app/).

This project was created using Vercel, Next.js, and ChatGPT (for the actual AI assistant & for logo generation).
